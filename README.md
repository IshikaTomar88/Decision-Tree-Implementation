# Dataset
Dataset: Iris Dataset
* Classes: 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
* Features:
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width
* Format: CSV (data/iris.csv)

#  Libraries Used
Library                    	Role
numpy	                      Numerical calculations
pandas	                    Data manipulation
scikit-learn	              Dataset splitting & evaluation metrics
matplotlib	                Basic plotting
seaborn	                    Visual EDA

# Steps
Task
1️⃣	Load and explore the dataset
2️⃣	Preprocess and split the data
3️⃣	Implement decision tree algorithm (Gini)
4️⃣	Train model on training data
5️⃣	Predict and evaluate performance on test data
6️⃣	Perform EDA to understand data distribution
7️⃣	Visualize decision-making logic (optional)
8️⃣	Summarize insights and conclude

# Data Preprocessing

* Verified class balance with value_counts()
* Checked nulls with df.isnull().sum()
* Explored feature distributions with seaborn.pairplot()

#  Model Training

Gini Impurity used as splitting criterion
Tree grows recursively based on best feature splits
Leaf nodes hold the majority class

# Model Evaluation

* High precision/recall indicates strong predictive power.
* Misclassifications mostly between Versicolor and Virginica.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Setosa is clearly separable from the other two classes.
* Petal Length and Petal Width are highly informative.
* Versicolor and Virginica slightly overlap — deeper trees help here.

# ✅ Conclusion
This project contain a comprehensive example of applying a Decision Tree Classifier to the Iris dataset. It covers the essential steps from data loading and preparation to model training, prediction, and visualization. The visualizations and text representation of the tree allow for a deeper understanding of how the model makes its predictions. This serves as a foundational example for applying Decision Trees to classification problems.
